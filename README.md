# Bathroom-Tracker
this is my final project for Web dev

1. Project Title/Group Members:
Bathroom Tracker (WIP title)
Group Members: 
Oscar Comunidad
2. Project Description:
This app would allow the user to input a location(street address or zip code) or allow the app to use the current browser location to find the nearest bathrooms within a certain radius 
Once the user gets their results they will be able to receive directions to their desired destination
A user can save places for later use and document any new places that might not be in the data set that I am using. 

3. Technical Overview
React.JS for the front end
Express.JS to handle server side requests 
React-router
React redux for state preservation 
Sequelize for any sort of database control 

4. API Integration
Google maps api? Possibly for distance calculation
NYC Open Data for bathroom data
Endpoint: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h87e-shkn.json
5. Running The App & Data Persistency
I plan on using vite to run and host the app on a local network, if it doesn't work then i can install a package called “serve”
For Data permanence, I will use supabase
